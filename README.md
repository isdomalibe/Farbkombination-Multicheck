# Farbkombinations-Spiel

In this website, you can practice **Farbkombinationen** that will appear in the **Multicheck ICT** exam. It is a great way to memorize the colors for the Multicheck.

This is the Link to try it out: https://isdomalibe.github.io/Farbkombination-Ubung/

Unlike the practice tool on the Gateway website, this version generates the color sequences **randomly** and is **not predictable**, providing a more challenging practice experience.
